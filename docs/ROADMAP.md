# ABVx Roadmap

Product direction: **Pocket OS** first, individual apps second.

ABVx should become a fast offline-first personal tool organized around actions:

```text
Capture / Remember / Read / Listen / Act / Reflect
```

Architecture:

- Product architecture: `docs/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Architecture decisions: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
- Browser architecture: `docs/BROWSER_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Visual layer: `docs/VISUAL_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Phase 1: Stability baseline

Status: v0.2.0 baseline is hardware-tested; the current checkpoint adds Dashboard, Music/Time polish, battery diagnostics, and Habits v2.

Remaining work:

- Continue smoke testing Music -> Record -> Reader -> Notes -> Files after SD operations.
- Hardware-stress Connections v3 before treating large Wi-Fi upload as stable.
- Keep release checkpoints small and hardware-test them before tagging public binaries.

Acceptance:

- Music plays smoothly.
- Record creates, saves, plays, and deletes stable short voice notes.
- Reader/Notes/Files keep seeing SD after Music/Record operations.
- Settings SD reprobe works.

## Phase 2: Pocket OS foundation

Goal: turn the app set into a fast personal operating layer.

### 2.1 One Button Capture

Status: MVP implemented from launcher.

- `R`: start voice recording.
- `N`: new note.
- `M`: play selected music.
- `T`: timer shortcut later.
- Fn combinations remain optional/later.

Next acceptance:

- Hardware-test launcher shortcuts.
- Add Inbox logging after shortcuts are stable.

### 2.2 Universal Inbox

- Implemented as a persistent internal Timeline.
- Events queue in RAM and are committed from the main loop to `/voice/INBOX.LOG`.
- Voice saves, note saves, habit checks, reading opens, music plays, and timer events are supported.
- Inbox view/refresh never touches SD.

Acceptance:

- Captured activity appears in Timeline and survives reboot.
- No background SD writes during Music/Reader/Recorder operation.

### 2.3 Context Resume / Dashboard

- Store last useful state: book, track, note, recording, timer/habits summary.
- Dashboard shows Resume, time, battery, SD, routines progress, and keyboard shortcuts.

Acceptance:

- User can return to last book/track/note quickly.

### 2.4 Fast Dashboard

- Dashboard MVP implemented; later it can become an optional boot/default screen.

Acceptance:

- Boot gives useful state, not only app list.

### 2.5 Timeline

- Simple list/detail view over Inbox is implemented.
- Later: richer grouping by day/context after RTC/time sync.
- Use manual day/session time until real sync exists.

Acceptance:

- User can review today's captured activity.

## Phase 3: Offline app polish

Apps stay as implementation modules under Pocket OS actions.

1. Record v2
   - One hardware-verified 20-second Voice mode.
   - Playback progress.
   - Better duration display.
   - Robust storage failure messages.

2. Reader v2
   - Real English/Russian book tests.
   - Bookmark polish if test reveals gaps.
   - Last-book startup shortcut feeds Context Resume.

3. Notes v2
   - Rename notes.
   - Better line wrapping for long text.
   - Safer delete/restore pattern if useful.

4. Files v2
   - Details polish.
   - `/cardputer` transfer folder workflow.
   - Optional delete safeguards.

5. Time/Habits polish
   - Timer presets.
   - Durable daily history, rename/disable/restore, streaks, and 7D/30D/365D summaries.
   - Mac CLI date/time sync implemented; Companion UI and NTP remain future work.

## Phase 4: Connections / Transfer

Goal: Cardputer as SD transfer device via Wi-Fi AP and later Mac Companion.

Connections v3 staged upload is implemented and awaiting hardware stress validation.

Planned redesign:

- Keep current list/download endpoints.
- Validate staged/chunked upload across TXT, books, MP3, and interrupted sessions.
- Keep all SD writes in the main loop, never HTTP handlers.
- Add phone-friendly web UI.
- FATFS LFN is enabled for UTF-8 Music reads; keep conservative 8.3 naming for transfer writes until staged upload is hardware-proven.

Acceptance:

- Upload MP3/TXT/WAV-sized files without AP drop or SD loss.
- Failed upload must not corrupt SD state.
- `/cardputer` works as generic transfer folder.

## Phase 5: Mac Companion

Goal: local Mac tool for preparing and moving content to Cardputer SD.

- Import books and convert to clean TXT for `/books`.
- Import music and convert/rename to Cardputer-friendly MP3 for `/music`.
- Prepare browser favorite packages.
- Pull notes and recordings from SD.
- Sync time/config.
- Proxy AI requests.
- Firmware update later.
- Use BookOrbit as reference for library/import ideas, not as direct base. See `docs/MAC_COMPANION_REFERENCES.md`.

## Phase 6: Prepared-first Browser

Goal: text browser for a small set of favorite sites, not a graphical browser.

- Mac-prepared favorite packages first.
- Cardputer reads cached text + links.
- Offline shows saved pages.
- Online refresh updates known favorites later.
- Text Search is an adapter, not a full Google browser.
- AI Chat handles general questions.

## Phase 7: AI / Command Surface

AI is online-only.

Preferred route:

- Cardputer -> Mac Companion -> OpenAI -> Cardputer.

Later/fallback:

- Cardputer -> OpenAI API directly.

MVP:

- Text input in English, French, or translit.
- Text answer displayed on Cardputer.
- Save answer to Notes.
- Voice input/output later.

No offline nano-LLM. No standalone Agent unless it becomes a real command/AI surface beyond launcher duplication.

## Parked hardware-dependent work

GPS/LoRa work is excluded from the active roadmap until the hardware module is physically available. The existing architecture note is retained only as future reference.

Architecture: `docs/ADVENTURE_LORA_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Final polish: Visual Layer

After core apps and companion workflows are stable, add Minimal/Art visual modes.

- Current UI remains default Minimal mode.
- Art mode is optional.
- Art mode is battery-gated and auto-falls back to Minimal when battery is low.
- Includes boot/sleep screens, transitions, cyberpunk accents, richer waveform/saver visuals.

## Out of scope

- Agro dashboards or market terminal positioning.
- Subscriptions or paid API model inside this firmware.
- Meshtastic integration.
- Full graphical browser.
- Offline fake AI / nano-LLM.

# ABVx Adventure / GPS / LoRa Architecture

Status: future architecture note. No firmware implementation yet.

## Hardware target

Planned module: M5Stack Cap LoRa 1262 for Cardputer ADV.

Relevant hardware capabilities:

- LoRa: SX1262.
- Frequency range: 868-923 MHz.
- Interface: SPI.
- TX power: up to +22 dBm.
- Receiver sensitivity: down to -147 dBm in low-data-rate LoRa mode.
- GNSS: ATGM336H/AT6668 class module.
- GNSS interface: UART, NMEA 0183.
- GNSS systems: GPS, QZSS, BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS.
- GNSS update rate: up to 10 Hz.

## Product framing

This module should not turn ABVx into a generic radio terminal.

The valuable product direction is:

```text
Pocket OS -> Adventure Mode -> local-first journey memory
```

GPS provides context. LoRa provides sparse long-range event relay.

## Key constraints

### LoRa is not file sync

LoRa must be treated as a low-bandwidth, low-duty-cycle channel.

Good payloads:

- GPS point;
- workout status;
- checkpoint;
- short text note;
- habit/event log;
- short command;
- time sync;
- small config;
- emergency/status message.

Bad payloads:

- MP3;
- books;
- recordings;
- images;
- large sync;
- continuous telemetry spam.

### EU duty-cycle limits matter

EU 868 MHz operation can be limited to 0.1%, 1%, or 10% duty cycle depending on exact sub-band. ABVx should default to conservative short packets and local buffering.

Design rule:

```text
store locally first
send short packets opportunistically
retry later if no relay
```

## Feature evaluation

### Breadcrumbs

Keep.

Use GPS to store route points during walk/run/ride.

MVP:

```text
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/TRACK.CSV
```

Fields:

```text
ms,lat,lon,alt,speed,fix,sats
```

Later export GPX in Mac Companion.

### Running Mode

Keep high priority after GNSS bring-up.

Screen should be purpose-built, not app-menu style:

```text
07.32 km
5:18 /km
38:12
```

Controls:

- OK: lap / mark;
- R: voice mark;
- GO: stop/end;
- Up/Down: music volume if music is playing.

### Voice Marks

Keep. Strong ABVx feature.

A voice mark is:

```text
GPS + time + short recording
```

Storage:

```text
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/MARK0001.WAV
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/MARKS.CSV
```

### Running Inbox

Keep.

This is One Button Capture with GPS context:

```text
R -> record 5-10 sec -> attach current GPS -> save into current journey
```

### Trail Memory / Places

Keep as later feature.

Do not implement first. It needs reliable local place matching and history.

MVP later:

```text
/sdcard/places/PLACES.TXT
```

Fields:

```text
id,name,lat,lon,radius_m,last_visit,last_context
```

### Bicycle / Ride Mode

Keep, but second after Running Mode.

It reuses the same Journey engine:

- distance;
- speed;
- moving time;
- elevation from GPS;
- music controls;
- voice marks.

### Adventure Mode

Keep as umbrella feature.

Adventure Mode is a session container:

```text
Journey
├─ GPS track
├─ voice marks
├─ text notes
├─ music listened
├─ reader context
└─ summary
```

Storage:

```text
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/META.TXT
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/TRACK.CSV
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/MARKS.CSV
/sdcard/journeys/J0001/*.WAV
```

### Places

Keep later.

Places makes the device feel alive:

```text
Welcome back
Last time: 18 May
Reading: Meditations p117
```

Implement only after Journey history exists.

### Home Relay

Keep as R&D after GPS/Journey MVP.

Architecture:

```text
Cardputer
  local journey/event buffer
  LoRa short packet
Home Relay
  ACK / TIME_SYNC / MESSAGE
Mac/NAS
  inbox / timeline / GPX builder
```

Packet classes:

Cardputer -> Home:

- PING;
- STATUS;
- GPS_POINT;
- MARK;
- NOTE_SHORT;
- WORKOUT_SUMMARY;
- LOW_BATTERY;
- RETURNED_HOME.

Home -> Cardputer:

- ACK;
- TIME_SYNC;
- MESSAGE;
- TODO;
- CONFIG_SMALL.

Important: relay failure must never block local recording or journey tracking.

## Recommended implementation order

### Phase A: GNSS Lab

Goal: prove hardware access.

- Detect module.
- Read NMEA over UART.
- Show fix/no-fix, satellites, lat/lon, speed, altitude.
- No SD writes at first.

Acceptance:

- Cardputer shows live coordinates outdoors.
- App remains stable without fix.

### Phase B: Journey / Breadcrumb MVP

Goal: local GPS track.

- Start/stop Journey.
- Log points every 30-60 seconds or every 100-200 m.
- Store CSV on SD.
- Show distance/time/speed.

Acceptance:

- A walk/run creates one journey folder and a readable track file.

### Phase C: Running Mode MVP

Goal: sports-computer screen.

- Large distance/pace/time screen.
- Music can continue.
- OK lap/mark.
- GO end.

Acceptance:

- Running Mode works without phone and without LoRa relay.

### Phase D: Voice Marks

Goal: attach voice notes to GPS.

- R records short mark.
- Save WAV + GPS/time row in MARKS.CSV.

Acceptance:

- User can record a mark during a walk/run and find it in Journey folder.

### Phase E: Mac Companion GPX builder

Goal: process Cardputer journeys on Mac.

- Import TRACK.CSV.
- Export GPX.
- Show voice marks on map later.

Acceptance:

- A Cardputer run can become a GPX file.

### Phase F: LoRa Lab

Goal: prove radio, not product feature yet.

- PING between Cardputer and home relay.
- RSSI/SNR display.
- Duty-cycle-safe send interval.

Acceptance:

- Cardputer can send and receive short packets reliably.

### Phase G: Home Relay MVP

Goal: sparse event relay.

- Send STATUS and WORKOUT_SUMMARY.
- Relay ACKs.
- Relay can send TIME_SYNC.

Acceptance:

- No file sync over LoRa.
- Missed relay does not lose local data.

## What not to do first

Do not start with:

- full LoRa mesh;
- Meshtastic integration;
- continuous live tracking every second;
- voice/audio over LoRa;
- map rendering on Cardputer;
- GPX generation on Cardputer;
- complex Places matching before Journey logs exist.

## Product priority

Highest value path:

```text
GNSS Lab -> Journey Track -> Running Mode -> Voice Marks -> Mac GPX export -> LoRa Relay
```

This preserves the offline-first product philosophy and avoids using LoRa for the wrong job.

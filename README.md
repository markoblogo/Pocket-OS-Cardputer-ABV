# M5Stack Cardputer ADV Unified Shell

Integrated PlatformIO firmware shell for M5Stack Cardputer ADV. It uses one menu, one app interface, centralized input, centralized power handling, centralized SD paths, and terminal-style UI.

## Build

```sh
platformio run -e m5stack-cardputer-adv
```

Environment:

- Board: `m5stack-stamps3`
- Framework: Arduino
- Main libraries:
  - `m5stack/M5Cardputer`
  - `bblanchon/ArduinoJson`
  - `earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio@1.9.7`

## Architecture

Apps implement:

- `begin(AppContext&)`
- `update()`
- `draw()`
- `onInput(InputEvent event)`
- `getTitle()`
- `getHelpLine()`

Raw keyboard/button input is only allowed in `src/core/InputManager.cpp`. Apps consume semantic `InputEvent` values only.

Shared managers:

- `InputManager`
- `PowerManager`
- `TerminalUI`
- `StorageManager`
- `SettingsManager`
- `AppManager`
- `NetworkManager`

Reusable components:

- `FileBrowser`
- `TextEditor`

## Controls

- BtnGO short press: primary/select/play/pause/start/pause by app context.
- BtnGO long press: Back/Menu.
- Enter: confirm/open/send; newline in editors unless overridden.
- Arrows: navigation, scroll, values.
- Text keys: only text fields/editors.
- Backspace: delete in text fields.
- First key/button while screen is off emits only `Wake`.

Every screen has a one-line footer.

| InputDiagnosticsApp | Implemented | Shows last semantic event and wake suppression. |
| SystemInfoApp | Implemented | SD, heap, Wi-Fi, IP, screen, build/features. |

## SD Card Layout

Copy `sdcard_template/` contents to the SD root. The firmware also creates missing folders:

- `/music`
- `/recordings`
- `/notes`
- `/books`
- `/browser`
- `/browser/bookmarks`
- `/browser/saved_pages`
- `/ai`
- `/config`
- `/logs`
- `/tmp`

Config files:

- `/config/settings.json`
- `/config/wifi.json`
- `/config/ai.json`
- `/config/bookmarks.json`
- `/config/app_state.json`
- `/config/randomizer_lists.txt`

## Known Limitations

- MP3 playback uses M5 Speaker buffered PCM output; Cardputer ADV audio quality/volume needs real-device tuning.
- Recorder uses M5 Mic chunk capture; sample stability and pauses need real-device validation.
- Browser text extraction is intentionally simple and bounded; JavaScript/CSS are ignored.
- AI text client supports OpenAI-compatible JSON and generic prompt payloads; provider-specific schemas may need config tuning.
- Web file manager has basic local-network endpoints without authentication by default.
- Clock NTP uses Europe/Paris timezone; manual time editing is minimal.
- Screen-off mode uses backlight brightness. Deep sleep is intentionally not used while background work may be active.

## SD card layout

Use FATFS 8.3-safe names for now.

```text
/sdcard/music/A.MP3
/sdcard/music/T01.MP3
/sdcard/books/EN1.TXT
/sdcard/books/RU1.TXT
/sdcard/notes/NOTE0001.TXT
/sdcard/rec/REC0001.WAV
```

Long filenames and long folder names are not reliable yet.

## Build

```sh
cd /Volumes/Work/Work/cardputer-abvx-minimal
. ~/esp/esp-idf-v5.4.2/export.sh
idf.py build
```

Firmware output:

```text
build/cardputer-abvx-minimal.bin
```

## Flash

Find the current USB modem port if needed:

```sh
ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*
```

Flash:

```sh
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem101 flash
```

Replace `/dev/cu.usbmodem101` with the actual port.

## Known limitations

- Reader/Notes text support is MVP only: English/Russian best-effort, in-RAM Reader bookmarks only, no persistent saved position, Reader/Notes include a compact Cyrillic bitmap fallback for Russian/Ukrainian text; French accents are not supported yet.
- Notes input supports latin text plus RU transliteration save mode; the edit screen shows latin translit because the current large font does not render Cyrillic. Punctuation is still limited by Cardputer arrow-key mappings.
- Recordings use `/sdcard/rec` instead of `/sdcard/recordings` because FATFS long filenames are not enabled yet.
- Music playback is chunk/blocking-based; controls may have small latency.
- Files MVP is read/open only; delete and rename are postponed.
- Future Transfer/Connections app should provide Wi-Fi AP + HTTP file manager for moving arbitrary files to/from SD without removing the card.
- Habits MVP has manual day rollover with `1 NEW DAY`; real calendar dates and weekly/monthly/yearly summaries are postponed until time sync/storage polish.
- Time block is implemented for this stage: manual runtime clock, stopwatch, timer, and alarm. Full power-off resets time; future Mac sync should set time once during sync.
- Screen-off playback/power optimization is not finalized yet.
- Dev diagnostics were removed from the normal build after proving MP3 decode/speaker path.
